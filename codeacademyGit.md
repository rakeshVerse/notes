- Showing Latest Commit Log `git show HEAD`
- Remove File from Staging `git reset HEAD scene-3.txt`
- Rolling Back to Last Commit `git checkout HEAD scene-5.txt`
- `git stash` allows you to get back to a clean commit point with a synchronized working tree, and avoid losing your local changes in the process of 
switching branches or tasks.You’re “stashing” your local work temporarily in order to update a previous commit and later on retrieve your work.
You can use `git stash pop` to retrieve from your stash.
- See the existing branches (Remote & Local) `git branch -a`
